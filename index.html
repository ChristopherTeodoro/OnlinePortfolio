      <p>I am a hard-working U.S. Army veteran with over 10 years of banking experience specializing in Consumer Lending Account Services.  I am offering a highly successful background in managing customer relations with proven leadership roles.  I thrive in a communicative work environment.  I am a skilled decision-maker with experience in multi-million-dollar accounting issues requiring precision research, investigative methods, complex systems utilization, presentation skills, and team coordinator talents.</p>

      <p>Every day I wake up with the intent on learning something new.  Right now that is learning everything about full-stack web development!</p>

      <p>I look forward to graduating boot camp real soon and utilizing my new skills while working at USAA.  If anyone would like to work on a project with me please do not hesitate to reach out.  Code, Eat, Sleep, Repeat...</p>
